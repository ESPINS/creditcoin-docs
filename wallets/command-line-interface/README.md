# Command-line Interface

A command-line interface (CLI) wallet is a type of digital wallet that operates through a command-line interface rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).

Unlike GUI wallets, which provide a visual interface with buttons and menus for interacting with the wallet, CLI wallets are text-based and require users to input commands directly into a command-line terminal or console. This type of wallet is typically favored by advanced users or developers who prefer the flexibility and control offered by the command line.

With a CLI wallet, users can perform tasks such as checking their account balance, sending or receiving cryptocurrency, generating new addresses, and managing other wallet-related functions. CLI wallets often provide a range of commands and options that allow users to customize their interactions with the wallet and automate certain tasks using scripts or programs.
