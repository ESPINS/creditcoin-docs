# Wallets

A blockchain wallet is an essential tool for managing and securing your digital assets on a blockchain network. In the world of blockchain technology, an account consists of a public-private key pair, and the private key is the key to accessing and controlling the transactions associated with that account. The utmost importance lies in safeguarding the private key, as anyone with access to it has full control over the associated assets.
