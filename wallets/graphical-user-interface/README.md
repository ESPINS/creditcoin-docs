#### Browser Wallets <a href="#browser-wallets" id="browser-wallets"></a>

Browser wallets, also known as web-based wallets, provide convenient access to your blockchain assets through a browser extension, eliminating the need for additional hardware or software installations. Browser wallets often have user-friendly interfaces and can be accessed from multiple devices, allowing for seamless management of your digital assets.

However, browser wallets may be more vulnerable to online security threats. As they are connected to the internet, there is a higher risk of hacking or phishing attacks that could compromise private keys and lead to the loss of your funds. It is crucial to ensure the wallet is installed in a safe environment; where both device and browser software are not compromised.
